# MPV Player Win64 Build

## Installation
Grab and extract the All-in-One archive from <https://github.com/nyfair/mpv-win64/releases>  
You can also manually install these pacman-based packages if you are using MSYS2  
All my builds are portable and compiled with VapourSynth support, these plugins will have no effect if MPV can't find python environment

## Main project site:
<https://mpv.io/>

## Configuration
<https://mpv.io/manual/>  
All your configurations can be saved within the ***portable_config*** subdirectory

## How to Compile
Fork this repo and build these packages by Github Action  
**NOTICE**  
Don't build it on your personal msys2 environment unless it was in sandbox, these shitty scripts will spoil your whole weekend!

## Detail
The FFmpeg and MPV library were built with the following libraries
- lame: MP3 Audio Encoding
- libogg/libvorbis-aotuv: Ogg Vorbis Audio Encoding
- opus: Opus Audio Encoding
- nvcodec: Nvidia Hardware Accelerated video Encoding/Decoding
- lcms2: Reading ICC Profiles for Your Monitor
- libass/freetype2/fribidi/harfbuzz: Subtitle Support
- luajit: Lua Plugin
- vapoursynth: VapourSynth Plugin and VSS Video Source
- shaderc/spirv/libplacebo: D3D11 & Vulkan Context
- libbluray/libdvdnav/libdvdread/libdvdcss: Parsing BD/DVD

## TODO ???
### Build FFmpeg with x264/x265/rav1e/SVT-AV1/VVenC for video encoding
I prefer to directly use these utilities
### Build FFmpeg with libfdk_aac for high quality AAC audio encoding
Yes, Fraunhofer AAC produce better aac than FFmpeg native, but it is still not in the top tier. I recommend you to use xHE-AAC or Apple AAC instead
### Build libass with fontconfig for POSIX-like system font configuration
Fontconfig sucks on windows, and... do you really want to learn it?
### No software av1 decoder?
Today all public av1 videos are just demos. I suggest you to try vvc for the purpose of testing
